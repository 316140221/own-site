  "title": "AI finds a hidden stress signal inside routine CT scans",
  "summary": "Researchers used a deep learning AI model to uncover the first imaging-based biomarker of chronic stress by measuring adrenal gland volume on routine CT scans. This new metric, the Adrenal Volume Index, correlates strongly with cortisol levels, allostatic load, perceived stress, and even long-term cardiovascular outcomes, including heart failure risk.",
