  "contentText": "Editor’s note : Warning: Although we’ve done our best to avoid spoiling anything major, please note this list does include a few specific references to several of the listed shows that some might consider spoiler-y.\n\nThis was a pretty good year for television, with established favorites sharing space on our list with some intriguing new shows. Streaming platforms reigned supreme, with Netflix and Apple TV dominating our list with seven and five selections each. Genre-wise, we've got a bit of everything: period dramas ( The Gilded Age , Outrageous ), superheroes ( Daredevil: Born Again ), mysteries ( Ludwig , Poker Face , Dept. Q ), political thrillers ( The Diplomats , Slow Horses ), science fiction ( Andor , Severance , Alien: Earth ), broody fantasy ( The Sandman ), and even an unconventional nature documentary ( Underdogs ).\n\nAs always, we’re opting for an unranked list, with the exception of our “year’s best” selection at the very end, so you might look over the variety of genres and options and possibly add surprises to your eventual watchlist. We invite you to head to the comments and add your own favorite TV shows released in 2025.\n\nRead full article\n\nComments",
