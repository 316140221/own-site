  "contentText": "When we put together our top 20 games of last year, we specifically called out Civilization 7 , Avowed , Doom: The Dark Ages , and Grand Theft Auto 6 as big franchise games we were already looking forward to for 2025. While one of those games has been delayed into 2026, the three others made this year's list of Ars' favorite games as expected. They join a handful of other highly anticipated sequels, ranging from big-budget blockbusters to long-gestating indies, on the \"expected\" side of this year's list.\n\nBut the games that really stood out for me in 2025 were the ones that seemed to come out of nowhere. Those range from hard-to-categorize roguelike puzzle games to a gonzo, punishing mountainous walking simulation, the best G eometry Wars clone in years, and a touching look at the difficulties of adolescence through the surprisingly effective lens of mini-games.\n\nAs we look toward 2026, there are plenty of other big-budget projects that the industry is busy preparing for (the delayed Grand Theft Auto VI chief among them). If next year is anything like this year, though, we can look forward to plenty more games that no one saw coming suddenly vaulting into view as new classics.\n\nRead full article\n\nComments",
