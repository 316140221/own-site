  "contentText": "Ever since 1993, I think I've unconsciously judged almost every game by how well it can capture how Wing Commander: Privateer made me feel.\n\nSteam and PlayStation (the two platforms I use the most) have been doing a year-in-review summary akin to the wildly popular Spotify Wrapped for the past few years. Based on these, I can report that my most-played games in 2025 were, from most hours down:\n\n- No Man's Sky\n\n- Civilization VII\n\n- Assassin's Creed Shadows\n\n- The Elder Scrolls IV Oblivion Remastered\n\n- The Lord of the Rings: Return to Moria\n\n- The Elder Scrolls III Morrowind\n\n- World of Warcraft\n\n- Meridian 59\n\n- Tainted Grail: Fall of Avalon\n\n- Unreal Tournament\n\nWith the exceptions of Civilization VII and Unreal Tournament , every one of those games is some kind of open-world experience that's all about immersing you in a far-flung land (or galaxy).\n\nRead full article\n\nComments",
