  "summary": "Researchers have built a fully implantable device that sends light-based messages directly to the brain. Mice learned to interpret these artificial patterns as meaningful signals, even without touch, sight, or sound. The system uses up to 64 micro-LEDs to create complex neural patterns that resemble natural sensory activity. It could pave the way for next-g…",
