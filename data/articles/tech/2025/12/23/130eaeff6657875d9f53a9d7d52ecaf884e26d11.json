  "contentText": "CBS cannot contain the online spread of a \"60 Minutes\" segment that its editor-in-chief, Bari Weiss, tried to block from airing.\n\nThe episode, \"Inside CECOT,\" featured testimonies from US deportees who were tortured or suffered physical or sexual abuse at a notorious Salvadoran prison, the Center for the Confinement of Terrorism. \"Welcome to hell,\" one former inmate was told upon arriving, the segment reported, while also highlighting a clip of Donald Trump praising CECOT and its leadership for “great facilities, very strong facilities, and they don’t play games.\"\n\nWeiss controversially pulled the segment on Monday, claiming it could not air in the US because it lacked critical voices, as no Trump officials were interviewed. She claimed that the segment \"did not advance the ball\" and merely echoed others' reporting, NBC News reported . Her plan was to air the segment when it was \"ready,\" insisting that holding stories \"for whatever reason\" happens \"every day in every newsroom.\"\n\nRead full article\n\nComments",
