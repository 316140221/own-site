We consider it the best Android phone you can buy, and right now, you can grab it at Amazon starting at $449 ($350 off) when you use promo code PIXEL10 , which drops Google’s entry-level flagship to its lowest price to date. If you prefer a better cameras or a bigger screen, Amazon is also offering the Pixel 10 Pro and the Pixel 10 Pro XL for $649 ($350 off) and $799 ($400 off), respectively, using the same code.\n\nGoogle Pixel 10 (128GB)\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n- $799 $449 at Amazon (with code PIXEL10)\n\n- $799 $599 at Best Buy\n\n- $799 $599 at Google\n\nGoogle Pixel 10 Pro\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n- $999 $649 at Amazon (with code PIXEL10)\n\n- $999 $749 at Best Buy\n\n- $999 $749 at Google Store\n\nIn her review , Verge senior reviewer Allison Johnson called the Pixel 10 a great, basic Android phone that offers some notable upgrades over its predecessor . It features a 6.3-inch OLED screen and a 120Hz refresh rate, along with a peak brightness of 3,000 nits, making it easy to see in direct sunlight. It also includes an array of helpful AI-powered tools and a dedicated telephoto camera — a first for a non-Pro Pixel phone — which is great for capturing portrait photos.\n\nOne of the Pixel 10’s more notable upgrades, though, is the addition of Qi2 wireless charging with built-in magnets — arguably the coolest part of the device — which means you don’t need a separate case for easy and precise charging alignment. The device also includes Google’s Tensor G5 chip, which is the same one found in the pricier Pro models; however, the Pixel 10 has slightly lower RAM (12GB versus 16GB). Still, you shouldn’t notice any major differences in everyday performance, unless you’re really pushing it with heavy multitasking and serious mobile gaming.\n\nOur main gripe with the Pixel 10 is that its main and ultrawide cameras aren’t quite as good as those on the Pro. That said, the standard Pixel produces pictures that are perfectly fine, while the telephoto camera makes for a nice addition. At its normal $799 price, we think the Pixel 10 is already a great value. At $449, it’s a dang good deal.\n\nRead our full Pixel 10 review .",
