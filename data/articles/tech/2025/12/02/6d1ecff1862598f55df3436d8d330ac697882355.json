  "title": "New state of quantum matter could power future space tech",
  "summary": "A UC Irvine team uncovered a never-before-seen quantum phase formed when electrons and holes pair up and spin in unison, creating a glowing, liquid-like state of matter. By blasting a custom-made material with enormous magnetic fields, the researchers triggered this exotic transformation—one that could enable radiation-proof, self-charging computers ideal f…",
