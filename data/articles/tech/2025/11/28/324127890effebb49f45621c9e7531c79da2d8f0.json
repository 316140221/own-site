  "title": "Miracle material’s hidden quantum power could transform future electronics",
  "summary": "Researchers have directly observed Floquet effects in graphene for the first time, settling a long-running scientific debate. Their ultrafast light-based technique demonstrates that graphene’s electronic properties can be tuned almost instantaneously. This paves the way for custom-engineered quantum materials and new approaches in electronics and sensing.",
