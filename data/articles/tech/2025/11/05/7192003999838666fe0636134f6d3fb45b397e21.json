  "title": "Breakthrough links magnetism and electricity for faster tech",
  "summary": "Engineers at the University of Delaware have uncovered a way to bridge magnetism and electricity through magnons—tiny waves that carry information without electrical current. These magnetic waves can generate measurable electric signals within antiferromagnetic materials, offering a possible foundation for computer chips that operate faster and use less pow…",
