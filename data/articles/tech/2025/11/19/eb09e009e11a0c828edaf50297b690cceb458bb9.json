  "title": "Quantum computers just simulated physics too complex for supercomputers",
  "summary": "Researchers created scalable quantum circuits capable of simulating fundamental nuclear physics on more than 100 qubits. These circuits efficiently prepare complex initial states that classical computers cannot handle. The achievement demonstrates a new path toward simulating particle collisions and extreme forms of matter. It may ultimately illuminate long…",
