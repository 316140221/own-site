  "title": "Nanoscale trick makes “dark excitons” glow 300,000 times stronger",
  "summary": "Researchers have found a way to make “dark excitons”—normally invisible quantum states of light—shine dramatically brighter by trapping them inside a tiny gold-nanotube optical cavity. This breakthrough boosts their emission 300,000-fold and allows scientists to switch and tune them with unprecedented precision. The work unlocks new possibilities for ultraf…",
