By experimenting with engineered versions of the bacterial pore aerolysin, they discovered that two key effects, rectification and gating, stem from the pore’s internal electrical charges and their interaction with passing ions. The team even built nanopores that imitate brain-like “learning,” hinting at future applications in bio-inspired computing and ion-based processors.",
