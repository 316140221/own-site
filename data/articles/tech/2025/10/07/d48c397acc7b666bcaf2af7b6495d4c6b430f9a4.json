  "title": "A strange quantum metal just rewrote the rules of electricity",
  "summary": "In a remarkable leap for quantum physics, researchers in Japan have uncovered how weak magnetic fields can reverse tiny electrical currents in kagome metals—quantum materials with a woven atomic structure that frustrates electrons into forming complex patterns. These reversals amplify the metal’s electrical asymmetry, creating a diode-like effect up to 100…",
