  "title": "Physicists just built a quantum lie detector. It works",
  "summary": "An international team has confirmed that large quantum systems really do obey quantum mechanics. Using Bell’s test across 73 qubits, they proved the presence of genuine quantum correlations that can’t be explained classically. Their results show quantum computers are not just bigger, but more authentically quantum. This opens the door to more secure communi…",
