  "summary": "Scientists have found that mushrooms can act as organic memory devices, mimicking neural activity while consuming minimal power. The Ohio State team grew and trained shiitake fungi to perform like computer chips, capable of switching between electrical states thousands of times per second. These fungal circuits are biodegradable and low-cost, opening the do…",
