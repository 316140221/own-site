  "summary": "Mars may look calm, but new research reveals it’s a world of fierce winds and swirling dust devils racing at hurricane-like speeds. Using deep learning on thousands of satellite images from European orbiters, scientists have discovered that Martian winds can reach up to 160 km/h — much stronger than previously thought. These powerful gusts play a key role i…",

Using deep learning on thousands of satellite images from European orbiters, scientists have discovered that Martian winds can reach up to 160 km/h — much stronger than previously thought. These powerful gusts play a key role in shaping the planet’s weather and climate by lifting vast amounts of dust into the atmosphere.",
