  "summary": "A team of engineers at North Carolina State University has designed a polymer “Chinese lantern” that can rapidly snap into multiple stable 3D shapes—including a lantern, a spinning top, and more—by compression or twisting. By adding a magnetic layer, they achieved remote control of the shape-shifting process, allowing the lanterns to act as grippers, filter…",
