  "title": "Scientists unlock the quantum magic hidden in diamonds",
  "summary": "Researchers have found a way to extract almost every photon from diamond color centers, a key obstacle in quantum technology. Using hybrid nanoantennas, they precisely guided light from nanodiamonds into a single direction, achieving 80% efficiency at room temperature. The innovation could make practical quantum sensors and secure communication devices much…",
