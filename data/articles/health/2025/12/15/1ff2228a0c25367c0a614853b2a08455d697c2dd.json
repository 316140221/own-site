  "summary": "Scientists have discovered that key compounds from cannabis—CBD and THC—show surprisingly strong effects against ovarian cancer cells. Used together, they slow cell growth, reduce colony formation, and may even block the cancer’s ability to spread. Even more promising, the treatment caused minimal harm to healthy cells and appears to work by restoring a dis…",
