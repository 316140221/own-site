A study of young women in Saudi Arabia found that both conditions were linked to significantly fewer NK cells—especially the circulating types responsible for destroying infected or abnormal cells. As anxiety severity increased, NK cell levels dropped even further, suggesting a stress-driven weakening of immune defenses.",
