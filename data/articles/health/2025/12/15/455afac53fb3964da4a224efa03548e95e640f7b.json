  "title": "AI found a way to stop a virus before it enters cells",
  "summary": "Researchers discovered a hidden molecular “switch” that herpes viruses rely on to invade cells. By combining AI, simulations, and lab experiments, they identified and altered a single amino acid that shut down viral entry. What once might have taken years was achieved far faster using computational tools. The findings open new possibilities for designing fu…",
