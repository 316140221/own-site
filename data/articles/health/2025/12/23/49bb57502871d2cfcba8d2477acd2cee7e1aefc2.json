  "title": "This ultra-sensitive imaging system can spot cancer earlier",
  "summary": "A new imaging technology can distinguish cancerous tissue from healthy cells by detecting ultra-weak light signals. It relies on nanoparticles that bind to tumor markers, making cancerous areas easier to identify. The system is far more sensitive than existing tools and could speed up cancer screening. Scientists believe it may help detect tumors earlier an…",
