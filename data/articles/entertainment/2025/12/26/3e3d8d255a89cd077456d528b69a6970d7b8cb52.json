  "contentText": "One of BTS &#8216; members is putting the &#8220;V&#8221; in Vogue Japan . As revealed a couple of days before Christmas, V is the publication&#8217;s latest cover star, representing &#8220;The New Standard of Cool&#8221; as the world heads into 2026.\n\nRelated\n\nBTS&#8217; Jung Kook Channels Nat King Cole With &#8216;The Christmas Song&#8217; Cover That&#8217;s Smooth Like&nbsp;Butter\n\nEverything the Members of BTS Have Said About Their Upcoming&nbsp;Reunion\n\nHere&#8217;s How V of BTS&#8217;s &#8216;White Christmas&#8217; Collaboration With Late &#8216;Idol&#8217; Bing Crosby Came&nbsp;Together\n\nThe issue finds V discussing his friendship with bandmates RM, Jin, SUGA, j-hope, Jimin and Jung Kook, as well as sharing his thoughts on his own character. Demonstrating his love for his &#8220;beloved members,&#8221; V said that he thinks &#8220;anywhere would be fun&#8221; as long as he&#8217;s with his crew.\n\n&#8220;I&#8217;d probably say, &#8216;I want to come back here again,&#8217; no matter where we go,&#8221; he told the Japanese publication, according to Google&#8217;s English translation. &#8220;Except for going to the company for work, of course [laughs].&#8221;\n\nAs for his sense of self, V acknowledged, &#8220;I can&#8217;t say yet that I&#8217;m a strong person.&#8221;\n\n&#8220;However, I want to be a strong person who will never falter, in order to live up to the expectations of the people I love,&#8221; the South Korean performer added. &#8220;But I do feel that I am a healthy person, both mentally and physically.&#8221;\n\nThe introspective interview comes at an exciting time for V, who was discharged from the South Korean military in June. In spring 2026, he&#8217;s set to make a comeback with the rest of his bandmates, who have a new album and world tour in store for ARMY after last releasing a full-length &#8212; Billboard 200 -topper Be &#8212; in 2020.\n\nDuring BTS&#8217; time apart, V released a number of solo projects. Last year, he dropped a modernized version of &#8220;White Christmas,&#8221; adding his voice to the late Bing Crosby&#8217;s. Shortly afterward, he shared a collaboration with Park Hyo Shin called &#8220;Winter Ahead.&#8221;\n\nV&#8217;s EP Layover dropped in 2023 and reached No. 2 on the Billboard 200.\n\nSee V on the cover of Vogue Japan and snaps from the photoshoot below.\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\nView this post on Instagram",
