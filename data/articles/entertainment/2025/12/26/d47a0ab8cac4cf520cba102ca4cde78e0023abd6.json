  "contentText": "Even if it&#8217;s time to spread some holiday cheer, 50 Cent stays ready to beef at all times.\n\nRelated\n\nMarlon Wayans Reveals What Made Him Back Away From 50 Cent Feud: &#8216;Leave Guys That Got Shot 9 Times&nbsp;Alone&#8217;\n\n50 Cent Promises to Recruit Eminem for &#8216;Street Fighter&#8217; Soundtrack: &#8216;New Music on the&nbsp;Way&#8217;\n\n10 Things We Learned About From 50 Cent&#8217;s &#8216;Sean Combs: The Reckoning&#8217; Diddy&nbsp;Documentary\n\nAfter the rapper took shots at the Let&#8217;s Rap About It podcast for its Sean Combs: The Reckoning criticism , cohosts Maino , Dave East , Jim Jones and Fabolous stepped into the booth to return fire with their &#8220;Christmas Special&#8221; freestyle titled &#8220;Squatter&#8217;s Rights&#8221; on Thursday (Dec. 25).\n\nLoso batted clean-up and they saved the best for last, as Fab went directly at 50 while taking a shot at the G-Unit mogul&#8217;s ex Daphne Joy, who dated Diddy and was named in a civil suit against the embattled Bad Boy boss. (50 also filed a lawsuit against Joy, with whom he shares a child, in May while he denied her allegations of physical abuse.)\n\n&#8220;You know I got power/ Your shorty got hot showered/ Catch her trying to leave like Tasha shot LaLa,&#8221; Fab raps over G-Unit&#8217;s &#8220;Rider, Pt. 2.&#8221; &#8220;The b—h hot Myla and no you not Allah/ You can both meet the creator, his first name not Tyler.&#8221;\n\nThe rest of the rapper podcasting foursome opted for lighter subliminal jabs, which saw Maino rhyming over 50&#8217;s &#8220;Back Down,&#8221; Capo choosing &#8220;I&#8217;ll Whip Ya Head&#8221; and Dave East smoking &#8220;A Baltimore Love Thing.&#8221;\n\n50 Cent has yet to directly respond to Fabolous or his podcast running mates on social media. Billboard has reached out to the Queens rapper for comment.\n\nTensions between the Let&#8217;s Rap About It podcast hosts and 50 were raised when the G-Unit rapper posted an alleged voicemail claiming Jim Jones owed money to the owner of the studio where Jim, Dave, Maino and Fab record their podcast. 50 referred to the foursome as squatters and taunted the crew, saying he was looking into buying the building where they record so he could be collecting their checks in the future.\n\nListen to the &#8220;Let&#8217;s Wrap About It: Christmas Special&#8221; dissing 50 below.",
