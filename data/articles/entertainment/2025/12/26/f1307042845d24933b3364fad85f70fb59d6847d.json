  "contentText": "Los Tigres del Norte is coming to Springfield for a surprising collaboration with The Simpsons . The storied regional Mexican music band will appear Sunday (Dec. 28) in an episode of the iconic animated series, performing a new song titled &#8220;El Corrido de Pedro y Homero,&#8221; the show and the band announced jointly on Friday (Dec. 26).\n\n&#8220;A legendary band. An original song. A very Simpsons twist,&#8221; reads a shared post on Instagram, which includes two images of the animated version of the members of Los Tigres on stage wearing their signature outfits. In one of them, they are accompanied by Homer Simpson wearing a charro hat, and Bumblebee Man, who in an episode titled &#8220;Team Homer,&#8221; is referred to as Pedro.\n\nThe alliance between Los Tigres del Norte and The Simpsons isn&#8217;t far fetched. Now in its 37th season, Fox&#8217;s animated series has addressed timeless themes such as social classes and societal issues, and hasn’t shied away from political and current topics. Los Tigres del Norte, meanwhile, has been known for over half a century for raising their voices in support of immigrants and speaking out on various social causes. Songs such as &#8220;La Reina del Sur,&#8221; &#8220;La Lotería,&#8221; &#8220;Pedro y Pablo&#8221; and of course &#8220;Jefe de Jefes&#8221; are part of the band&#8217;s extensive repertoire.\n\nSunday’s episode of The Simpsons , whose title has not yet been revealed, will air on Fox and stream on Disney+.\n\nCheck out the announcement of the collaboration below.\n\nView this post on Instagram",
