  "contentText": "Tyler, The Creator surprised fans on Christmas with a gift under the tree, in the form of the &#8220;You&#8217;re a Mean One, Mr. Grinch&#8221; artist dropping off a new freestyle to end the year in style.\n\nThe Grammy-winning rapper got back to the bars with the hard-hitting &#8220;Sag Harbor&#8221; freestyle, which found him delivering one bristling punchline after the next, like a thousand-pound weight was lifted off Tyler&#8217;s chest.\n\nFor those who don&#8217;t know, Sag Harbor is located in the Hamptons on New York&#8217;s Long Island. On the track, Tyler reflects on his banner year, which includes notching a fourth consecutive No. 1 album atop the Billboard 200 with Don&#8217;t Tap the Glass .\n\n&#8220;Son got his fourth No. 1 in a row, I&#8217;m a champion/ Don&#8217;t tap the glassy, rather tap the pedal on the chassi&#8217;,&#8221; he raps over the breezy production.\n\nFollowing the success of his global Chromakopia World Tour , the 34-year-old has his sights set on playing stadiums for his next trek.\n\n&#8220;F—k who y&#8217;all calling the best, I seen their ticket sales (Tch), give it a rest/ They got y&#8217;all craniums hexed, I&#8217;m on the road to doin&#8217; stadiums next,&#8221; he predicts.\n\nTyler brings the avid freestyle to a close while thanking the fans for a great 2025. Text pops up in the video that reads: &#8220;What an incredible year, thank you for all the eyes and ears.&#8221;\n\nIn addition to &#8220;Sag Harbor,&#8221; it was a celebratory Christmas Day for Tyler, who officially made his feature film debut with the arrival of A24&#8217;s Marty Supreme . The star will also look to continue his winning ways at the Grammys in February, following another six nominations.\n\nWatch the &#8220;Sag Harbour&#8221; freestyle and Tyler&#8217;s &#8220;Sugar On My Tongue (Freak Mix)&#8221; videos below.",
