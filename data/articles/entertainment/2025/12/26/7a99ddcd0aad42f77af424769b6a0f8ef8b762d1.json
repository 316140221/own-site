  "contentText": "Jung Kook might just be Nat King Cole undercover, because the BTS singer just released a rendition of &#8220;The Christmas Song&#8221; that&#8217;s buttery smooth.\n\nRelated\n\nJung Kook Says Next Spring Will Be &#8216;More Important Than Ever&#8217; Ahead of BTS&nbsp;Reunion\n\nJung Kook of BTS Wants to &#8216;Show Different Sides&#8217; of Himself Going Forward: &#8216;I Don&#8217;t Want to Be&nbsp;Confined&#8217;\n\nEverything the Members of BTS Have Said About Their Upcoming&nbsp;Reunion\n\nReleased just a couple of days before Christmas, the festive cover finds Jung Kook delivering some of his sultriest vocals to date. &#8220;Chestnuts roasting on an open fire, Jack Frost nipping at your nose/ Yuletide carols being sung by a choir and folks dressed up like Eskimos,&#8221; he croons over chill, ambient keyboards. &#8220;Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe help to make the season bright/ Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow will find it hard to sleep tonight.&#8221;\n\nAs the song picks up, the K-pop star fleshes out the performance with his own lush harmonies stacked on top of each other. Staying true to the original lyrics, he ends with a message to &#8220;kids&#8221; from ages 1 to 92: &#8220;Merry Christmas to you.&#8221;\n\nCole&#8217;s &#8220;The Christmas Song&#8221; first charted on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1960. It reached its peak decades later, hitting No. 6 this year.\n\nJung Kook&#8217;s cover of the Christmas classic serves as a year-end gift to ARMY, as the fanbase eagerly awaits spring 2026, when BTS will finally make its comeback after two-plus years apart to fulfill South Korean military obligations and work on solo projects. In addition to a new album, the septet also has a world tour in the works.\n\n&#8220;I think this spring will be more important than ever,&#8221; Jung Kook recently teased in an interview with Elle Korea . &#8220;So I sincerely hope you all have a safe and enjoyable spring.&#8221;\n\nCheck out Jung Kook&#8217;s version of &#8220;The Christmas Song&#8221; below.",
