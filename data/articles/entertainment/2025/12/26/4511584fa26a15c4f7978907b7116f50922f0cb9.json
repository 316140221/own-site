  "contentText": "Howie Klein , the influential and forward-thinking record executive and political activist whose artist-first philosophy helped bring alternative music into the mainstream, died Wednesday (Dec. 24) after a battle with pancreatic cancer, his sister announced on social media. He was 77.\n\nWidely respected for championing creative freedom and resisting censorship, Klein left his mark on the music business through influential roles at Sire Records and Reprise Records, as well as earlier work in radio and indie labels.\n\nRelated\n\nExecutive Turntable: Sphere Hires NFL Tech Innovator — Plus, Superstruct Founder&nbsp;Departs\n\nDiddy Seeks Immediate Release From Prison in Appeals Argument\n\nBig Sean Named Creative Director of Global Experience for Detroit Pistons\n\nKlein, a Brooklyn native, launched his music career in the late 1960s while studying at Stony Brook University on Long Island, where he wrote about music and booked concerts. After relocating to San Francisco in the 1970s, he emerged as a prominent DJ at KSAN-FM and co-founded 415 Records, an indie label that became a key incubator for punk and new wave acts including Romeo Void, Translator, Wire Train and the Nuns. At 415, Klein also developed forward-thinking ideas about record promotion, arguing as early as 1980 that labels should target college radio stations strategically rather than flooding the system with unwanted promo copies — an approach that anticipated modern data-driven marketing.\n\nIn the mid-1980s, Klein joined Seymour Stein&#8217;s Sire Records, working closely with a roster that included Lou Reed, the Ramones, Talking Heads, Depeche Mode and Uncle Tupelo. When Stein moved Sire’s distribution from one Warner Music label to another (Warner Bros. Records -> Elektra) in the mid-1990s, Klein hung back and was named president of Reprise Records. During his six-year tenure, he oversaw a remarkably eclectic lineup, including Green Day, Alanis Morissette, Neil Young, Joni Mitchell, Wilco, Fleetwood Mac, Paul Westerberg and Enya.\n\nAn April 1995 Billboard article noting Klein&#8217;s appointment as the president of Reprise.\n\nKnown for his hands-on, artist-friendly leadership style, Klein earned deep loyalty from musicians, particularly those who felt marginalized elsewhere in the industry.&nbsp;All-female rockers Babes in Toyland, for example, publicly praised his accessibility and respect for artists.&nbsp;&#8220;He came out and met us, and he was very excited about the record and was really pumped up,&#8221; the band’s Lori Barbero told Billboard in 1995. &#8220;They have a lot of women that work there, and they are not just secretaries… They don’t treat us like we’re stupid, and if we have a problem, we feel we can call Howie Klein, and he’ll talk to us.&#8221;\n\nKlein’s steady leadership at Reprise made the label a haven for artists, and his sudden departure in 2001 following the Time Warner–AOL merger triggered a rift with one of its most acclaimed acts: Wilco. Soon after he left, execs asked the sure-footed band to alter its finished (and now-seminal) album, Yankee Hotel Foxtrot . Confident in the record as it stood, Wilco refused, sparking tense negotiations. Ultimately, the band bought back the rights to the album and exited its contract , which had called for several more releases.\n\nRelated\n\nWilco Freed From Reprise, Plans Short&nbsp;Tour\n\nBeyond music, Klein was a passionate advocate for free expression and progressive causes. He supported Rock the Vote, opposed censorship and received honors including the Spirit of Liberty Award (his co-honoree? Rob Reiner) and the ACLU’s Bill of Rights Award. In 1994, while still at Sire, he curated the pro-choice compilation Just Say Roe , emphasizing music&#8217;s ability to spark debate on prickly topics.&nbsp; “[Sire&#8217;s] goal as a label is to expose Sire artists and to sell records — I readily admit that,” he told Billboard . “But why can’t we also evoke positive thought and debate about important issues?”\n\nAfter leaving Reprise, Klein turned his focus to political activism, serving on the board of People for the American Way and launching the ultra-liberal blog DownWithTyranny! . “From the beginning of time, singers and songwriters have always had a special role to play in alerting the public in current affairs,” Klein told Billboard &#8216;s Steve Knopper following the election of Donald Trump in 2016. “This isn’t just a regular situation, of a Richard Nixon or Ronald Reagan, or, for a Republican, a Barack Obama. This is something unique in American history. Donald Trump is an anomaly.”\n\nIn 2011, the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame and Museum archived the Howie Klein Collection, preserving materials from his career that document a transformative era in modern music history.",
