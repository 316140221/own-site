  "contentText": "John Farnham has made a rare public appearance, marking his first sighting in several months following treatment for oral cancer.\n\nThe Australian music icon, 76, was photographed with family over the Christmas period in images shared by his sons on social media.\n\nOne photo, posted by son Rob Farnham on Facebook, showed the singer seated at a table surrounded by family on Boxing Day, smiling alongside his wife, Jill. “Boxing Day shenanigans,” the caption read.\n\nA second image, shared on Instagram by Farnham’s other son, James Farnham , featured a similar family gathering with the caption, “Merry Christmas from the Farnhams.”\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\nThe appearances mark Farnham’s first public glimpse since early 2025, when he attended a birthday celebration for his wife. Since then, the singer has largely remained out of the public eye following a major health battle that began in 2022, when doctors discovered a tumour in his mouth.\n\nFarnham underwent a 12-hour surgery that required the removal of parts of his mouth and jaw, followed by eight weeks of radiation treatment. He was later declared cancer-free, though the surgery significantly affected his ability to speak and sing.\n\nThe singer addressed the impact of the operation in his 2024 memoir The Voice Inside , writing candidly about the physical and emotional toll of the procedure. “My facial disfigurement from the surgery means I can’t open my mouth wide enough for a strip of spaghetti, let alone to sing,” he wrote. “I can’t get the movement to make the sounds I want to make… It’s a very disconcerting thing. And trying hurts.”\n\nWidely regarded as one of Australia’s most beloved performers, Farnham’s career spans more than three decades, with enduring hits including “You’re the Voice.” He remains the only Australian artist to have a No. 1 album in five consecutive decades.\n\nThis Christmas also marked a personal milestone for Farnham, who celebrated the holiday as a grandfather for the first time. His son James and partner Dr. Tessa Effendi welcomed their son, Jett, in June.\n\nReflecting on that chapter in his memoir, Farnham wrote that while his performing days may be behind him, music remains part of his life. “I think it is fair to say the only singing I’ll be doing is lullabies — and the only performing will be for a special audience of one; my first grandchild,” he wrote, before adding, “But you know me… never say never.”",
