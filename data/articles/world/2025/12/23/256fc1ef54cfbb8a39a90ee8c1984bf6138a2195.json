  "title": "Nonstop laughing for 20 minutes: Japan’s ritual for good fortune",
  "summary": "Every winter in Osaka, thousands gather at a temple to laugh—nonstop—for 20 minutes. Known as \"Owarai Shinji\", this rare ritual draws on ancient Japanese mythology, where laughter once brought the sun back to the world. More than humor, they see it as a disciplined act of unity, hope, and renewal.",
