The star, which quietly orbits a dormant black hole, appears to be spinning far faster than it should—and its internal “starquakes” suggest it may have once collided and merged with another star. Even more puzzling, its chemical makeup makes it look ancient, while its internal structure reveals it’s relatively young.",
