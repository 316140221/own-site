  "title": "Scientists reveal why some brains stop growing too soon",
  "summary": "Researchers used miniature human brains grown in the lab to uncover why certain genetic mutations lead to abnormally small brains. Changes in actin disrupted the orientation of early brain cell divisions, causing crucial progenitor cells to disappear too soon. This reduced the brain’s ability to grow normally. The work offers a clear cellular explanation fo…",
