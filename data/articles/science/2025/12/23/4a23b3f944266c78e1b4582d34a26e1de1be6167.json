The K2 site preserves thousands of remains from a prehistoric flood-fed lake that acted like a natural bone trap 72 million years ago. Alongside common local dinosaurs, researchers uncovered the first well-preserved titanosaur skeletons ever found in the region. The site reveals how ancient European dinosaur ecosystems formed and evolved in the final chapter of the age of dinosaurs.",
