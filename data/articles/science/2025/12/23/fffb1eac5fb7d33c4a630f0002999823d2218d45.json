  "title": "Physicists found a way to make thermodynamics work in the quantum world",
  "summary": "More than 200 years ago, Count Rumford showed that heat isn’t a mysterious substance but something you can generate endlessly through motion. That insight laid the foundation for thermodynamics, the rules that govern energy, work, and disorder. Now, researchers at the University of Basel are pushing those rules into the strange realm of quantum physics, whe…",
